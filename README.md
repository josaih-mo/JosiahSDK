Need freedom? It's there! 
### How to use:
* **1. Create an empty GameObject**
You can make anything else though
* **2. Add the "Josiah Mod Loader" script to it**
that's basically where the magic happens
* **3. customize the fields**
make sure to use persistive data if you're building for stuff like android! 
**Heads up for tvOS builders: [tvOS: "Application.persistentDataPath is not supported and returns an empty string."](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html)**
